Mr and Mrs Dursley, of номера 4, Privet Drive, были proud to сказать, что они были очень нормальными, thank you very much. Они были the last люди you’d expect to быть involved в anything strange or mysterious, because они just не hold with such nonsense.

Mr Dursley был the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. Он был a big, beefy человек with hardly any neck, although он did have a очень large moustache. Mrs Dursley была thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came в очень useful as она spent so much of своего time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a маленького son called Dudley and в их opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, но они also had a secret, and их greatest fear был that somebody would discover это. Они не think они could bear это if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter была Mrs Dursley’s sister, но они не had met для several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended она не had a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as это было possible to быть. The Dursleys shuddered to think что the neighbours would сказать if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew что the Potters had a маленького son, too, но они не had never even seen him. Этот boy был another good reason для keeping the Potters away; они не want Dudley mixing with a child like что.
