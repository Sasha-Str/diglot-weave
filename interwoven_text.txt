Mr {{и|и|and}} Mrs Dursley, of {{номер|номер|number}} four, Privet Drive, {{были|быть|were}} proud to say {{что|что|that}} they {{были|быть|were}} perfectly normal, thank {{вы|вы|you}} {{очень|очень|very}} much. They {{были|быть|were}} the last people {{вы|вы|you}}’d expect to {{быть|быть|be}} involved in anything strange {{или|или|or}} mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.

Mr Dursley {{был|быть|was}} the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. {{Он|он|He}} {{был|быть|was}} a big, beefy {{мужчина|мужчина|man}} with hardly any neck, although {{он|он|he}} did have a {{очень|очень|very}} large moustache. Mrs Dursley {{была|быть|was}} thin {{и|и|and}} blonde {{и|и|and}} had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in {{очень|очень|very}} useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small {{сын|сын|son}} called Dudley {{и|и|and}} in their opinion there {{был|быть|was}} {{не|не|no}} finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything {{что|что|that}} they wanted, but they also had a secret, {{и|и|and}} their greatest fear {{был|быть|was}} {{что|что|that}} somebody would discover {{это|это|it}}. They didn’t think they could bear {{это|это|it}} if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter {{была|быть|was}} Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister {{и|и|and}} her good-for-nothing husband {{были|быть|were}} as unDursleyish as {{это|это|it}} {{было|быть|was}} possible to {{быть|быть|be}}. The Dursleys shuddered to think {{что|что|what}} the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew {{что|что|that}} the Potters had a small {{сын|сын|son}}, too, but they had {{никогда|не|never}} even {{видели|видеть|seen}} him. {{Этот|это|This}} boy {{был|быть|was}} another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like {{это|это|that}}.

When Mr {{и|и|and}} Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there {{было|быть|was}} {{ничего|никто|nothing}} about the cloudy sky outside to suggest {{что|что|that}} strange {{и|и|and}} mysterious things would soon {{быть|быть|be}} happening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as {{он|он|he}} picked out his most boring tie for work {{и|и|and}} Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

{{Никто|никто|None}} of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek {{и|и|and}} tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed, because Dudley {{был|быть|was}} now having a tantrum {{и|и|and}} throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’ chortled Mr Dursley as {{он|он|he}} left the {{дом|дом|house}}. {{Он|он|He}} got into his {{машина|машина|car}} {{и|и|and}} backed out of {{номер|номер|number}} four’s drive.

{{Это|это|It}} {{было|быть|was}} on the corner of the street {{что|что|that}} {{он|он|he}} noticed the first sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley {{не|не|didn’t}} realise {{что|что|what}} {{он|он|he}} had {{видел|видеть|seen}} – then {{он|он|he}} jerked his head around to look again. There {{была|быть|was}} a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there {{не|не|wasn’t}} a map in sight. {{Что|что|What}} could {{он|он|he}} have {{был|быть|been}} thinking of? {{Это|это|It}} must have {{был|быть|been}} a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked {{и|и|and}} stared at the cat. {{Он|он|It}} stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner {{и|и|and}} up the road, {{он|он|he}} watched the cat in his mirror. {{Он|он|It}} {{была|быть|was}} now reading the sign {{что|что|that}} said Privet Drive – {{нет|не|no}}, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps {{или|или|or}} signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake {{и|и|and}} put the cat out of his mind. As {{он|он|he}} drove towards town {{он|он|he}} thought of {{ничего|никто|nothing}} except a large order of drills {{он|он|he}} {{был|быть|was}} hoping to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills {{были|быть|were}} driven out of his mind by something else. As {{он|он|he}} sat in the usual morning traffic jam, {{он|он|he}} couldn’t help noticing {{что|что|that}} there seemed to {{быть|быть|be}} a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get-ups {{вы|вы|you}} {{видели|видеть|saw}} on young people! {{Он|он|He}} supposed {{это|это|this}} {{был|быть|was}} some stupid new fashion. {{Он|он|He}} drummed his fingers on the steering wheel {{и|и|and}} his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They {{были|быть|were}} whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley {{был|быть|was}} enraged to {{видеть|видеть|see}} {{что|что|that}} a couple of them {{не|не|weren’t}} young at all; why, that {{мужчина|мужчина|man}} had to {{быть|быть|be}} older than {{он|он|he}} {{был|быть|was}}, {{и|и|and}} wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then {{это|это|it}} struck Mr Dursley {{что|что|that}} {{это|это|this}} {{был|быть|was}} probably some silly stunt – these people {{были|быть|were}} obviously collecting for something … yes, {{это|это|that}} would {{быть|быть|be}} {{это|это|it}}. The traffic moved on, {{и|и|and}} a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings {{машина|машина|car}} park, his mind back on drills.

Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If {{он|он|he}} hadn’t, {{он|он|he}} might have found {{это|это|it}} harder to concentrate on drills that morning. {{Он|он|He}} {{не|не|didn’t}} {{видел|видеть|see}} the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed {{и|и|and}} gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had {{никогда|не|never}} {{видели|видеть|seen}} an owl even at nighttime. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. {{Он|он|He}} yelled at five different people. {{Он|он|He}} made several important telephone calls {{и|и|and}} shouted a bit more. {{Он|он|He}} {{был|быть|was}} in a {{очень|очень|very}} good mood until lunch-time, when {{он|он|he}} thought {{он|он|he}}’d stretch his legs {{и|и|and}} walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the baker’s opposite.

{{Он|он|He}}’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until {{он|он|he}} passed a group of them next to the baker’s. {{Он|он|He}} eyed them angrily as {{он|он|he}} passed. {{Он|он|He}} {{не|не|didn’t}} know why, but they made him uneasy. {{Эти|это|This}} lot {{были|быть|were}} whispering excitedly, too, {{и|и|and}} {{он|он|he}} couldn’t {{видеть|видеть|see}} a single collecting tin. {{Это|это|It}} {{было|быть|was}} on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, {{что|что|that}} {{он|он|he}} caught a few words of {{что|что|what}} they {{были|быть|were}} saying.

‘The Potters, {{это|это|that}}’s right, {{это|это|that}}’s {{что|что|what}} {{я|я|I}} heard –’

‘– yes, their {{сын|сын|son}}, Harry –’

Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. {{Он|он|He}} looked back at the whisperers as if {{он|он|he}} wanted to say something to them, but thought better of {{это|это|it}}.

{{Он|он|He}} dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary {{не|не|not}} to disturb him, seized his telephone {{и|и|and}} had almost finished dialling his {{дом|дом|home}} {{номер|номер|number}} when {{он|он|he}} changed his mind. {{Он|он|He}} put the receiver back down {{и|и|and}} stroked his moustache, thinking … {{нет|не|no}}, {{он|он|he}} {{был|быть|was}} being stupid. Potter {{не|не|wasn’t}} such an unusual name. {{Он|он|He}} {{был|быть|was}} sure there {{были|быть|were}} lots of people called Potter who had a {{сын|сын|son}} called Harry. Come to think of {{это|это|it}}, {{он|он|he}} {{не|не|wasn’t}} even sure his nephew {{был|быть|was}} called Harry. {{Он|он|He}}’d {{никогда|не|never}} even {{видел|видеть|seen}} the boy. {{Это|это|It}} might have {{был|быть|been}} Harvey. {{Или|или|Or}} Harold. There {{было|быть|was}} {{не|не|no}} point in worrying Mrs Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. {{Он|он|He}} didn’t blame her – if {{он|он|he}}’d had a sister like {{это|это|that}} … but all the same, those people in cloaks …

{{Он|он|He}} found {{это|это|it}} a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon, {{и|и|and}} when {{он|он|he}} left the building at five o’clock, {{он|он|he}} {{был|быть|was}} still so worried {{что|что|that}} {{он|он|he}} walked straight into someone just outside the door.

‘Sorry,’ {{он|он|he}} grunted, as the tiny old {{мужчина|мужчина|man}} stumbled {{и|и|and}} almost fell. {{Это|это|It}} {{было|быть|was}} a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised {{что|что|that}} the {{мужчина|мужчина|man}} {{был|быть|was}} wearing a violet cloak. {{Он|он|He}} {{не|не|didn’t}} seem at all upset at {{быть|быть|being}} almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile {{и|и|and}} {{он|он|he}} said in a squeaky voice {{что|что|that}} made passers-by stare: ‘Don’t {{быть|быть|be}} sorry, my dear sir, for {{ничего|никто|nothing}} could upset {{меня|мне|me}} today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should {{быть|быть|be}} celebrating, {{этот|это|this}} happy, happy day!’

{{И|и|And}} the old {{мужчина|мужчина|man}} hugged Mr Dursley around the middle {{и|и|and}} walked off.

Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. {{Он|он|He}} had {{был|быть|been}} hugged by a complete stranger. {{Он|он|He}} also thought {{он|он|he}} had {{был|быть|been}} called a Muggle, whatever {{это|это|that}} {{был|быть|was}}. {{Он|он|He}} {{был|быть|was}} rattled. {{Он|он|He}} hurried to his {{машина|машина|car}} {{и|и|and}} set off {{дом|дом|home}}, hoping {{он|он|he}} {{был|быть|was}} imagining things, {{что|что|which}} {{он|он|he}} had {{никогда|не|never}} hoped before, because {{он|он|he}} didn’t approve of imagination.

As {{он|он|he}} pulled into the driveway of {{номер|номер|number}} four, the first thing {{он|он|he}} {{видел|видеть|saw}} – {{и|и|and}} {{это|это|it}} didn’t improve his mood – {{был|быть|was}} the tabby cat {{он|он|he}}’d spotted that morning. {{Он|он|It}} {{был|быть|was}} now sitting on his garden wall. {{Он|он|He}} {{был|быть|was}} sure {{это|это|it}} {{был|быть|was}} the same one; {{он|он|it}} had the same markings around its eyes.

‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.

The cat {{не|не|didn’t}} move. {{Он|он|It}} just gave him a stern look. {{Было|быть|Was}} {{это|это|this}} normal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, {{он|он|he}} let himself into the {{дом|дом|house}}. {{Он|он|He}} {{был|быть|was}} still determined {{не|не|not}} to mention anything to his wife.

Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter {{и|и|and}} how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had {{был|быть|been}} put to bed, {{он|он|he}} went into the living-room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:

‘{{И|и|And}} finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported {{что|что|that}} the nation’s owls have {{были|быть|been}} behaving {{очень|очень|very}} unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night {{и|и|and}} are hardly ever {{видели|видеть|seen}} in daylight, there have {{были|быть|been}} hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself a grin. ‘Most mysterious. {{И|и|And}} now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to {{быть|быть|be}} any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?’

‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘{{Я|я|I}} {{не|не|don’t}} know about {{это|это|that}}, but {{это|это|it}}’s {{не|не|not}} only the owls {{что|что|that}} have {{были|быть|been}} acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire {{и|и|and}} Dundee have {{были|быть|been}} phoning in to tell {{мне|мне|me}} {{что|что|that}} instead of the rain {{Я|я|I}} promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have {{были|быть|been}}
