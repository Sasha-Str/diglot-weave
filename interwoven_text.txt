Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to сказать, что они были perfectly нормальные, thank you very much. Они были the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because они just не hold with such nonsense.

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a большой, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very большой moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in их opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything они wanted, но они also had a secret, and их greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. Они не think они could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, но они не met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would скажут if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, но они had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; они не want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
