(Note: Beatrice. I use this word, as it is pronounced {in|in|in} {l'|il|the} Italian, as consisting {di|di|of} four syllables, {di|di|of} which {la|il|the} third is a long one.) Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence,
Who prompts my speech. When {in|in|in} {la|il|the} sight {di|di|of} my Master
I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.”

She then was silent, {e|e|and} I thus began:
“O Lady! by whose influence alone,
{l'|il|the} {uomo|uomo|mankind} excels whatever is contain’d
{in|in|within} that heaven which hath {il|il|the} orb smallest,
{si|si|so} thy command delights me, that to obey,
If it were done already, would seem late.
{Non|non|No} need hast thou farther to speak thy will;
Yet tell {la|il|the} reason, why thou art {non|non|not} loth
To leave {lo|il|the} space ample, where to return
Thou burnest, {per|per|for} this centre here beneath.”

She then: “Since thou {si|si|so} deeply wouldst inquire,
I will instruct thee briefly, why {non|non|no} dread
Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone
Are to be fear’d, whence evil may proceed,
{non|non|none} else, {per|per|for} {non|non|none} are terrible beside.
I am {si|si|so} fram’d by God, thanks to his grace!
That any suff’rance {di|di|of} your misery
Touches me {non|non|not}, {non|non|nor} flame {di|di|of} that fire fierce
Assails me. {In|in|in} high heaven a blessed dame
Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief
That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,
That God’s stern judgment to her will inclines.”
To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:
“Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
{e|e|and} I commend him to thee.” At her word
Sped Lucia, {di|di|of} all cruelty {la|il|the} foe,
{e|e|and} coming to {il|il|the} place, where I abode
Seated with Rachel, her {di|di|of} days ancient,
She thus address’d me: “Thou {la|il|the} praise true {di|di|of} God!
Beatrice! why is {non|non|not} thy succour lent
To him, who {si|si|so} much lov’d thee, as to leave
{per|per|for} thy sake all {la|il|the} multitude admires?
{Non|non|Dost} thou {non|non|not} hear how {il|il|the} wail pitiful,
{Non|non|nor} mark {la|il|the} death, which {in|in|in} {la|il|the} flood torrent,
Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?”
{Non|non|Ne’er} {tra|tra|among} {uomini|uomo|men} did any with such speed
Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,
As when these words were spoken, I came here,
Down from my blessed seat, trusting {la|il|the} force
{di|di|of} thy pure eloquence, which thee, {e|e|and} all
Who well have mark’d it, into honour brings.”

“When she had ended, her {gli|il|the} eyes bright beaming
Tearful she turn’d aside; whereat I felt
Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will’d,
Thus am I come: I sav’d thee from {la|il|the} beast,
Who thy near way across {il|il|the} mount goodly
Prevented. What is this comes o’er thee then?
Why, why {non|non|dost} thou hang back? why {in|in|in} thy breast
Harbour {la|il|the} fear vile? why hast {non|non|not} courage there
{e|e|and} {il|il|the} daring noble? Since three maids {si|si|so} blest
Thy safety plan, e’en {in|in|in} {la|il|the} court {di|di|of} heaven;
{e|e|and} {si|si|so} much certain good my words forebode.”

As florets, by {il|il|the} frosty {aria|aria|air} {di|di|of} night
Bent down {e|e|and} clos’d, when {il|il|the} {giorno|giorno|day} has blanch’d their leaves,
Rise all unfolded on {i|il|the} stems spiry;
{si|si|so} was my fainting vigour new restor’d,
{e|e|and} to my heart {il|il|the} courage kindly ran,
That I as one undaunted soon replied:
“O full {di|di|of} pity she, who undertook
My succour! {e|e|and} thou kind who didst perform
{si|si|so} soon her {il|il|the} behest true! With such desire
Thou hast dispos’d me to renew my voyage,
That my {il|il|the} purpose first fully is resum’d.
Lead on: one only will is {in|in|in} us both.
Thou art my guide, my master thou, {e|e|and} lord.”

So spake I; {e|e|and} when he had onward mov’d,
I enter’d on {il|il|the} way deep {e|e|and} woody.
