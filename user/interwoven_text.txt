{Nel|in|In the} midway {di|di|of} this our {vita|vita|life} mortal,\nI found me {in|in|in} a gloomy wood, astray\nGone from {il|il|the} path direct: {ed|e|and} e\u2019en to tell\nIt were no easy task, how savage wild\nThat forest, how robust {e|e|and} rough its growth,\nWhich to remember only, my dismay\nRenews, {in|in|in} bitterness not far from death.\nYet to discourse {di|di|of} what there good befell,\nAll else will I relate discover\u2019d there.\nHow first I enter\u2019d it I scarce can say,\nSuch sleepy dullness {in|in|in} that instant weigh\u2019d\nMy senses down, when {il|il|the} path true I left,\nBut when a foot {di|di|of} mountain I reach\u2019d, where clos\u2019d\n{La|il|The} valley, that had pierc\u2019d recesses {di|di|of} my heart with dread,\nI look\u2019d aloft, {e|e|and} saw his shoulders broad\nAlready vested with beam {di|di|of} that planet,\nWho leads all wanderers safe through every way.\n\nThen was a little respite to {la|il|the} fear,\nThat {in|in|in} recesses {di|di|of} my heart deep had lain,\nAll {di|di|of} that night, so pitifully pass\u2019d:\n{E|e|And} as a man, with difficult short breath,\nForespent with toiling, \u2019scap\u2019d from sea to shore,\nTurns to {il|il|the} perilous wide waste, {e|e|and} stands\nAt gaze; e\u2019en so my spirit, that yet fail\u2019d\nStruggling with terror, turn\u2019d to view {lo|il|the} straits,\nThat none hath pass\u2019d {e|e|and} liv\u2019d. My weary frame\nAfter short pause recomforted, again\nI journey\u2019d on over that lonely steep,\n\n{Il|il|The} hinder foot still firmer. Scarce {l'|il|the} ascent\nBegan, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,\n{E|e|And} cover\u2019d with a speckled skin, appear\u2019d,\nNor, when it saw me, vanish\u2019d, rather strove\nTo check my onward going; that ofttimes\nWith purpose to retrace my steps I turn\u2019d.\n\n{L'|il|The} hour was prime {di|di|of} morning, {e|e|and} on his way\nAloft {il|il|the} sun ascended with those stars,\nThat with him rose, when Love divine first mov\u2019d\nThose its fair works: so that with joyous hope\nAll things conspir\u2019d to fill me, {la|il|the} skin gay\n{Di|di|Of} that swift animal, {il|il|the} matin dawn\n{E|e|And} {la|il|the} season sweet. Soon that joy was chas\u2019d,\n{E|e|And} by new dread succeeded, when {in|in|in} view\nA lion came, \u2019gainst me, as it appear\u2019d,\n\nWith his head held aloft {e|e|and} hunger-mad,\nThat e\u2019en {l'|il|the} air was fear-struck. A she-wolf\nWas at his heels, who {in|in|in} her leanness seem\u2019d\nFull {di|di|of} all wants, {e|e|and} many a land hath made\nDisconsolate ere now. She with such fear\nO\u2019erwhelmed me, at {la|il|the} sight {di|di|of} her appall\u2019d,\nThat {dell'|di|of the} height all hope I lost. As one,\nWho with his gain elated, sees {il|il|the} time\nWhen all unwares is gone, he inwardly\nMourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,\nHaunted by that fell beast, never {in|in|in} peace,\nWho coming o\u2019er against me, by degrees\nImpell\u2019d me where {il|il|the} sun {in|in|in} silence rests.\n\nWhile to {lo|il|the} lower space with backward step\nI fell, my ken discern\u2019d {la|il|the} form {di|di|of} one,\nWhose voice seem\u2019d faint through long disuse {di|di|of} speech.\nWhen him {in|in|in} that great desert I espied,\n\u201cHave mercy on me!\u201d cried I out aloud,\n\u201cSpirit! or living man! what e\u2019er thou be!\u201d\n\nHe answer\u2019d: \u201cNow not man, man once I was,\n{E|e|And} born {di|di|of} Lombard parents, Mantuana both\nBy country, when {il|il|the} power {di|di|of} Julius yet\nWas scarcely firm. At Rome my {vita|vita|life} was past\nBeneath {il|il|the} mild Augustus, {nel|in|in the} time\n{Di|di|Of} fabled deities {e|e|and} false. A bard\nWas I, {e|e|and} made upright son {di|di|of} Anchises\n{Il|il|The} subject {di|di|of} my song, who came from Troy,\nWhen {le|il|the} flames prey\u2019d on haughty towers {di|di|of} Ilium.\nBut thou, say wherefore to such perils past\nReturn\u2019st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount\nAscendest, cause {e|e|and} source {di|di|of} all delight?\u201d\n\n\u201c{E|e|And} art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,\nFrom which such copious floods {di|di|of} eloquence\nHave issued?\u201d I with front abash\u2019d replied.\n\u201cGlory {e|e|and} light {di|di|of} all {il|il|the} train tuneful!\nMay it avail me that I long with zeal\nHave sought thy volume, {e|e|and} with love immense\nHave conn\u2019d it o\u2019er. My master thou {e|e|and} guide!\nThou he from whom alone I have deriv\u2019d\nThat style, which for its beauty into fame\nExalts me. See {la|il|the} beast, from whom I fled.\nO save me from her, thou illustrious sage!\u201d
