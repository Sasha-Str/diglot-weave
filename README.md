# Diglot Weave
The diglot weave is supposed to assist in language learning.
The idea of a diglot weave is to take a text in the learner's native language (here English), and replace some of the words with their target language (TL) equivalent(s). 
In principle it should not require too much mental effort as the meaning of TL words should be mostly understood by context. It should help to develop familiarity with the TL, but should not replace other language learning activities. For me, it will be for when I don't want to be expending too much mental effort in learning the language, but still want to be doing something to maintain/improve it.
